Firefly vs Serenity
===================

It is a tricky question: *which is better*? Giving either answer is likely to
start a **flamewar**!

-----

In coding terms: ``firefly >= serenity``.


Argument for Firefly
--------------------

The `pilot episode <https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0579535/?ref_=ttep_ep11>`_ is
a master class in set-up, once through the cold-open it:

* quickly establishes who each of the crew are and their relationships
* introduces aspects of the world through the crew's smuggling, interaction
  with the alliance (cry baby, cry!), and weak negotiation point (Badger)
* adds Simon and River 
* explains Reavers

And, it does all this without it feeling like it is being jammed down your
throat.

.. note:: Unfortunately, the pilot was aired out of order, so this masterclass
 was late, airing as episode 11.
